## Key Integration Points Between Phases:

### Database Evolution:
```sql
-- Phase 1: Core tables
companies, users, clients, sites, inspections, estimates, work_orders

-- Phase 2: Business operations tables
technician_skills, route_optimizations, technician_locations
customer_users, service_requests, payment_methods, subscriptions
message_templates, communication_logs, analytics_cache
```

### API Expansion:
```
Phase 1: /api/auth, /api/inspections, /api/estimates, /api/work-orders
Phase 2: /api/scheduling, /api/portal, /api/payments, /api/communications
```

### Frontend Architecture:
```
Phase 1: Admin dashboard + basic mobile forms
Phase 2: + Customer portal + Advanced dispatcher tools + Analytics dashboards
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategies:

### Technical Risks:
- **Database Performance**: Implement proper indexing and query optimization from start
- **Real-time Features**: Use WebSockets or Server-Sent Events for live updates
- **Mobile Reliability**: Implement offline-first architecture with sync

### Business Risks:
- **Payment Compliance**: Ensure PCI DSS compliance from day one
- **Customer Adoption**: A/B test portal features before full rollout
- **Integration Failures**: Build robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Scaling Concerns:
- **Load Testing**: Regular performance testing as features are added
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive application and infrastructure monitoring
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular automated backups with disaster recovery testing
